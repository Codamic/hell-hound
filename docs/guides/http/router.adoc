== HTTP Router
HellHound uses `Pedestal Router` for HTTP routing

===Routes vs. Routers

HellHound distinguishes between routes and routers.

"Routes" are data that describe a structure of decisions to be made in handling requests.

"Routers" are the functions (supplied as Interceptors) that analyze incoming requests against the routes.

Pedestal uses protocols to connect routes to routers. Either can be varied independently.
