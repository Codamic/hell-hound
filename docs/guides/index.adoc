== What is HellHound?
*HellHound* is a set of libraries to create simple and elegant programs based on streams. An *HellHound* application
basically is a <<systems,system>> of <<components,components>> which work together in order to achieve a common goal.
Components form one or more data pipelines through <<workflow,workflows>>. In general systems are a great way to
manage the lifecycle and data flow or your program and components are awesome for managing the state and dependencies
of different pieces of your program.

=== Goals
The ultimate goal of *HellHound* is to create a set of libraries for creating well orginized, simple, easy to test, easy to
to scale and distribute applications using Clojure and Clojurescipt around streams and data pipelines.

Another goal of this project is to create a tool which allows developers to focus on their business logic as much as possible
while *HellHound* takes care of different aspects of their distributed and scalable software in an opinionated way. We want
to achieve this using different component which provides these kind of tasks.

=== Road Map for next stable version
Our near future goals are:
* Support for configurable execution model for the entire system and components as well.
  In addition to manage the execution model of the system automatically by HellHound, We like to add a configurable
  execution model which allows users to change the behavior based on the use case. For example user might want
  to run a component on a blocking thread pool or control the number of threads in each thread pool under hood.

* Support for Kafka streams. We're working on adding the support for kafka streams in our stream abstractions so
  users can easily take advantage of good features of Apache Kafka in their systems. (Development Started)

* Support for IO spec for each component. The basic idea is to add the support for a pair of configurations to
  components that allow them to define specs for incoming and outgoing messages. It should be possible to enforce
  these spec on messages. Another purpose of having these specs is to create a diagram later that demonstrates how
  data transform in the system. This way by creating the diagram in any given time, as a developer we would have
  better understanding of our system and data flow. This feature would be awesome specially for new developers.

* Better support for REPL driven development

If you like to help us with any of these. Give us a shout.
