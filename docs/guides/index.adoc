== What is HellHound?
*HellHound* is a set of libraries to create simple and elegant programs based on streams. An *HellHound* application
basically is a <<systems,system>> of <<components,components>> which work together in order to achieve a common goal.
Components form one or more data pipelines through <<workflow,workflows>>. In general systems are a great way to
manage the lifecycle and data flow or your program and components are awesome for managing the state and dependencies
of different pieces of your program.

HellHound provides different built-in components for different types of systems. For example Webserver component for creating
a fullstack web application, or a kafka component for a data processing application.

=== Goals
The ultimate goal of *HellHound* is to create a set of libraries for creating well orginized, simple, easy to test, easy to
to scale and distribute applications using Clojure and Clojurescipt around streams and data pipelines.

Another goal of this project is to create a tool which allows developers to focus on their business logic as much as possible
while *HellHound* takes care of different aspects of their distributed and scalable software in an opinionated way. We want
to achieve this using different component which provides these kind of tasks.
