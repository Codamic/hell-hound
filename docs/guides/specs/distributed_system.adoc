= Distributed Systems
The goal of this section is to describe how we should implement distributed systems in order
to run a system on a cluster of nodes which are running *HellHound*

== Expectations
We should be able to:

* [ ] Execute a system across several coordinating nodes in parallel.
* [ ] Assign a cluster of nodes to an specific component.
* [ ] Have a fault tolerant distributed system.
* [ ] Choose between availablity and consistancy in case of failure.
* [ ] Pause/Cancel/Restart any unit of execution at any given time.
