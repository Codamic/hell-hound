= HellHound Streams
In order to make a better abstraction around systems we need to abstract away the `stream`
concept. Up until now (1.0.0-alpha3) We are using `manifold.stream` library which is great
but has some problems. For example the execution model is not a good fit for out use case.

== Expectations
Streams shoud be:

* [ ] *Connectable*: We should be able to connect streams together and create a pipeline.

* [ ] *Consumable*: We should be able to consume data from stream in sync and async fashion.

* [ ] *Sinkable*: We should be able to put data on a stream.
