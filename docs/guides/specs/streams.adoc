= HellHound Streams
In order to make a better abstraction around systems we need to abstract away the `stream`
concept. Up until now (1.0.0-alpha3) We are using `manifold.stream` library which is great
but has some problems. For example the execution model is not a good fit for out use case.

== Expectations
Streams shoud be:

* [ ] *Connectable*: We should be able to connect streams together and create a pipeline.

* [ ] *Consumable*: We should be able to consume data from stream in sync and async fashion.

* [ ] *Sinkable*: We should be able to put data on a stream.

== Suggestions

* It might be a good idea to create a `channel` type similar to `ManyToManyChannel` implementation
of the core async but instead of working with the go blocks just queue up the handler into a job
queue. In order to do this we need to change the Splitter implementation to work with it.
